# Week 5 Polymorphism

This file contains a summary of the information in lab05.html.  That file contains the lab 
instructions and should be opened in a browser so you can see all the images.

In this lab we will: 
* Practise using git
* Rewrite the Simple Container Library using generics
* Explore Swift's protocols
* Create a parser for fractions and complex numbers

Before you start the lab, you'll need to:

* Complete Lab 3 (for the Fraction and Complex classes)
* Complete Lab 4 (for the Simple Container Library)

As you go through the lab use good git commit practises (with sensible commit
messages).

You should be well on the way with the assignment by now. We would like you to
check that your commits are reaching the correct repository, if you have yet to
make any changes.

When you accepted the assignment, your own private repo was created under the
oucs-cosc346-s2-2018 organisation. Github Organisations are ways to group users
and repos. The permissions on your assignment repository are set so that only
you (and your partner, if you're working in pairs), Hamza and Paul will be able
to access it.

Your practise for this week is to make a small change to the README.md and push
the changes so that we can see it (or if you've been working on the 
assignment, you can skip this step). Once you've made a change and pushed check 
with us (via email) and we'll let you know it's been successful. If you're working 
in a pair, make sure you can both see the changes and can commit to the repo.

Note that you shouldn't make your own private copy of the repo in your account 
otherwise we won't be able to see your assignment!
